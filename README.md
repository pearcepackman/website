# Website_1
  This project was my first attempt at building a personal website for myself using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Read more below.
  
## A little bit about this project:
  I was interested in learning web development concepts and wanted to learn some React and JavaScript. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React while doing this project.\
  Things that went well:\
    Learning CSS and styling the website\
    Learning the React framework\
    Becoming more familiar with JavaScript as a language

  Things that went poorly:\
    Fitting the website for mobile devices\
    Contact form submission

  I learned a lot creating this website but unfortunately felt it did not meet my standards to actively publish and serve as a resume. I wanted to upload this project as a sign of my previous experience.\
  I am currently working on creating a website that is far superior, and will fix the things that went poorly.

  Thank you for reading.
